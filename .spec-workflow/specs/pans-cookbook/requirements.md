# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Pans Cookbook is a web-based recipe finder application that enables users to discover and manage cooking recipes with intelligent ingredient-based filtering and automated recipe acquisition via web scraping. The application builds on proven patterns from the Herbalism app, adapting its database architecture, Streamlit interface, and scraping capabilities to focus on culinary recipes with traditional parsing methods and optional AI enhancements.

The system prioritizes reliability through traditional web scraping and manual validation forms, while offering optional AI integration with personal API keys for recipe variations and suggestions. This approach ensures core functionality works without external dependencies while enabling AI-powered features for users who want them.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature supports the goal of creating an accessible, user-friendly recipe management system that works reliably as a web application accessible from anywhere. The application prioritizes practical functionality over complex AI dependencies, using AI only where it provides clear value (recipe variations) rather than for core parsing operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a home cook, I want to filter recipes based on ingredients I have available, so that I can efficiently find recipes I can make without shopping trips.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select ingredients from my available inventory THEN the system SHALL display only recipes that can be made with those ingredients
2. WHEN I view filtered recipes THEN the system SHALL highlight which ingredients I have and which are missing
3. WHEN I have all required ingredients THEN the recipe SHALL be marked as "Can Make" with green styling
4. WHEN I'm missing ingredients THEN the recipe SHALL show "Missing X ingredients" with red styling and crossed-out missing items
5. WHEN I filter by multiple ingredients THEN the system SHALL use AND logic to show recipes containing all selected ingredients

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a recipe collector, I want to add new recipes to the database via URL scraping with manual validation, so that I can build a comprehensive personal recipe collection with accurate data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide a recipe URL THEN the system SHALL scrape the recipe content if allowed by robots.txt using traditional HTML parsing
2. WHEN scraping succeeds THEN the system SHALL extract recipe name, ingredients list, instructions, prep time, cook time, and servings using structured selectors
3. WHEN parsing is complete THEN the system SHALL display a validation form with all extracted fields for manual review and correction
4. WHEN I review extracted data THEN the system SHALL allow me to move ingredients between categories (main ingredients, seasonings, garnishes)
5. WHEN I save the validated recipe THEN the system SHALL add new ingredients to the database and link them to the recipe
6. WHEN scraping fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and allow manual recipe entry

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a recipe enthusiast, I want optional AI-powered recipe suggestions and variations using my personal API key, so that I can explore creative cooking ideas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure my AI API key THEN the system SHALL validate the key and store it securely for my user account
2. WHEN I select a recipe with AI enabled THEN the system SHALL offer to generate variations (dietary adaptations, ingredient substitutions, difficulty modifications)
3. WHEN I request recipe suggestions THEN the system SHALL use AI to suggest recipes based on available ingredients with creative combinations
4. WHEN AI features are unavailable THEN the core recipe browsing and filtering SHALL continue to work normally
5. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN each SHALL be able to configure their own AI API keys independently

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a meal planner, I want to view detailed recipe information with accurate categorization, so that I can make informed cooking decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view a recipe THEN the system SHALL display complete cooking instructions, prep/cook times, and serving information
2. WHEN available THEN the system SHALL show nutritional information and dietary tags (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc.)
3. WHEN I view recipe details THEN the system SHALL show difficulty level, cuisine type, and meal category
4. WHEN nutritional data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate this rather than showing placeholder values
5. WHEN I edit recipe information THEN the system SHALL allow updates to all fields with validation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want to manage the ingredient database with manual validation tools, so that recipe filtering remains accurate and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access ingredient management THEN the system SHALL show all ingredients with usage counts, categories, and merge suggestions
2. WHEN duplicate ingredients are detected THEN the system SHALL provide a review interface to manually merge or keep separate
3. WHEN I validate new ingredients THEN the system SHALL show similar existing ingredients and allow me to choose whether to create new or use existing
4. WHEN I categorize ingredients THEN the system SHALL support bulk operations and save category preferences for future parsing
5. WHEN ingredients are merged THEN the system SHALL update all recipe references automatically

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a recipe browser, I want to search and filter recipes by multiple criteria simultaneously, so that I can quickly find recipes matching my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the search function THEN the system SHALL search recipe names, ingredients, and descriptions with fuzzy matching
2. WHEN I apply multiple filters THEN the system SHALL combine them logically (cuisine AND dietary-restriction AND cooking-time)
3. WHEN I filter by cooking time THEN the system SHALL allow range selection (e.g., 15-30 minutes total time)
4. WHEN I filter by dietary restrictions THEN the system SHALL use inclusive filtering (vegan recipes appear in vegetarian results)
5. WHEN no recipes match filters THEN the system SHALL show helpful suggestions to broaden the search

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save favorite recipes and create meal collections with sharing capabilities, so that I can organize recipes for specific occasions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I mark recipes as favorites THEN the system SHALL save this preference to my user account
2. WHEN I create a meal collection THEN the system SHALL allow naming, categorizing, and adding multiple recipes
3. WHEN I view collections THEN the system SHALL show aggregate information like total prep time and combined shopping list
4. WHEN I share collections THEN the system SHALL generate exportable formats (PDF shopping list, recipe cards, collection links)
5. WHEN I access shared collections THEN the system SHALL allow me to save them to my own account

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a web application user, I want secure account management with personalized settings, so that I can access my recipes from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create an account THEN the system SHALL require email verification and secure password storage
2. WHEN I log in from different devices THEN the system SHALL sync my favorites, collections, and settings
3. WHEN I configure API keys THEN the system SHALL encrypt and store them securely per user account
4. WHEN I manage my data THEN the system SHALL provide export/import functionality for recipes and collections
5. WHEN I delete my account THEN the system SHALL remove all personal data while preserving anonymized recipes for other users
