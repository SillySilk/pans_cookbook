# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enhanced Scraper System will comprehensively improve the scraper_ui.py functionality to provide intelligent recipe parsing with automatic herb discovery and database integration. This feature transforms the current basic scraper into an intelligent system that not only extracts recipe information but also automatically identifies unknown herbs, gathers their information through AI, and seamlessly integrates both recipes and herbs into the SQLite database. The system will ensure data consistency, provide comprehensive field mapping, and offer robust error handling for production-ready recipe and herb management.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This enhancement directly supports the core vision of creating a comprehensive herbal recipe and knowledge management system by:
- Automating the knowledge acquisition process for both recipes and herbs
- Maintaining data quality and consistency across the database
- Reducing manual data entry and improving user workflow efficiency
- Expanding the herb database organically through recipe discovery

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Recipe Parsing with Complete Field Mapping

**User Story:** As a user adding recipes, I want the AI to extract and map all recipe fields accurately, so that recipes are stored with complete metadata in the database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI parses a recipe THEN it SHALL extract and populate all Recipe model fields including route, safety_summary, contraindications, interactions, pediatric_note, pregnancy_note, sanitation_level, storage_instructions, shelf_life_days, batch_size_value, and batch_size_unit
2. WHEN recipe instructions contain newlines THEN the system SHALL preserve formatting while ensuring proper database storage
3. WHEN recipe data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL provide sensible defaults and flag missing critical information
4. IF the AI cannot confidently extract a field THEN it SHALL leave the field empty rather than guess

### Requirement 2: Intelligent Herb Discovery and Database Integration

**User Story:** As a user scraping recipes, I want unknown herbs to be automatically identified and added to my database, so that my herb collection grows organically without manual research.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a recipe contains herbs not in the current database THEN the system SHALL identify these unknown herbs
2. WHEN an unknown herb is identified THEN the AI SHALL extract comprehensive herb information including description, scientific_name, traditional_uses, craft_uses, current_evidence_summary, contraindications, interactions, and toxicity_notes
3. WHEN herb information is extracted THEN the system SHALL validate the information against safety standards and flag potentially dangerous content
4. IF herb information cannot be confidently determined THEN the system SHALL create a basic herb entry with minimal verified information

### Requirement 3: Database-Centric Architecture with SQLite Integration

**User Story:** As a system user, I want all recipe and herb data to be stored directly in the SQLite database, so that data consistency is maintained across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a recipe is saved THEN it SHALL be stored directly in the SQLite database rather than CSV files
2. WHEN new herbs are discovered THEN they SHALL be automatically added to the herbs table with proper sequential IDs
3. WHEN the scraper runs THEN it SHALL use the existing database connection and models from database.py
4. IF database operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback incomplete transactions

### Requirement 4: Advanced LM Studio Prompt Engineering

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the AI prompts to be optimized for accuracy and completeness, so that extracted information is reliable and comprehensive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN prompting for recipe parsing THEN the system SHALL use structured prompts that specify exact field requirements and validation rules
2. WHEN prompting for herb information THEN the system SHALL request specific categories of information with safety guidelines
3. WHEN AI responses are received THEN the system SHALL validate JSON structure and required fields before processing
4. IF AI responses are malformed THEN the system SHALL attempt repair and provide fallback handling

### Requirement 5: Robust Error Handling and Data Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the scraper to handle errors gracefully and validate all data, so that my database remains consistent and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages and allow manual correction
2. WHEN herb information is extracted THEN the system SHALL validate safety information against known dangerous plants or compounds
3. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL rollback changes and preserve data integrity
4. WHEN network operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

### Requirement 6: Enhanced User Interface and Workflow

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive interface that shows me what's happening during the scraping process, so that I can review and verify information before it's saved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recipes are parsed THEN the interface SHALL display all extracted fields in an organized review form
2. WHEN new herbs are discovered THEN the interface SHALL show the herb information for user review and approval
3. WHEN data is being processed THEN the interface SHALL show clear progress indicators and status updates
4. IF errors occur THEN the interface SHALL provide actionable guidance for resolution

### Requirement 7: Intelligent Herb Matching and Conflict Resolution

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to intelligently match herb names and handle conflicts, so that duplicate herbs are avoided and similar herbs are properly identified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN herb names are similar to existing entries THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation of whether it's the same herb or a new variety
2. WHEN scientific names match existing herbs THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate entries and suggest updates to existing entries
3. WHEN herb common names vary THEN the system SHALL use scientific names as the primary identifier for deduplication
4. IF herb matching is uncertain THEN the system SHALL present options to the user for manual decision

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Separate modules for recipe parsing, herb extraction, database operations, and UI components
- **Modular Design**: Create reusable components for AI parsing, data validation, and database integration
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize coupling between scraping, parsing, and database layers
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between AI parsing service, database models, and UI components

### Performance
- AI parsing operations SHALL complete within 30 seconds for typical recipe content
- Database operations SHALL use transactions to ensure consistency and performance
- Memory usage SHALL be optimized for handling large recipe text content

### Security
- AI prompts SHALL include safety guidelines to prevent extraction of dangerous or illegal content
- Input validation SHALL prevent injection attacks and malformed data
- Database operations SHALL use parameterized queries and proper error handling

### Reliability
- System SHALL maintain database consistency even during failures
- AI parsing failures SHALL not corrupt existing data
- Network timeouts SHALL be handled gracefully with appropriate fallbacks

### Usability
- Interface SHALL provide clear feedback for all operations
- Error messages SHALL be actionable and user-friendly
- Data review process SHALL be intuitive and comprehensive
